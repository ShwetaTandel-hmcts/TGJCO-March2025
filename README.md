# Blackjack Coding Challenge
## How to run the program

1. Run the DeckOdCards.js
2. Run the blackJack.js
3. Input the values you want



## Objective

Teams must create an interactive command-line (CLI) program that plays a single round of Blackjack using the provided Deck of Cards API. Points will be awarded based on the number of correctly implemented features.


## Submission Requirements

Teams must submit a video demo (max 2.5 minutes) showcasing all implemented features.

The program must be interactive, allowing a user to play one full round against a dealer.

Winning teams will have programs manually tested by judges to verify 

## Basic Requirements (Mandatory Features)

The program must:

1. Allow one player to play against the dealer.

2. Start a round by dealing two cards to both the player and the dealer.

3. Allow the player to choose to 'Hit' (receive another card) or 'Stand' (end their turn).

4. Show the player's total after each move.

5. The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17 or higher.

6. Display the round's outcome:

Player wins if their total is higher than the dealer’s without going over 21.

Dealer wins if the dealer’s total is higher than the player's without going over 21.

Push (Draw) if both totals are equal.

Player loses immediately if they go over 21 (bust), without the dealer having to play.

NOTE: all face cards(J,Q,K) are worth 10 and Aces are worth 1 OR 11 depending on what is most adventurous

## Additional Features (Bonus Points)

Features should be implemented in order and must be compatible with all previous features.

- **Support 1-5 players**: Upon starting, prompt the user to enter the number of players (1 to 5). Allow each player to input a name (up to 12 characters). Each player's score should be clearly displayed during their turn.
- **Multiple rounds with one deck**: After player setup, allow the user to select a number of rounds before shuffling the deck. The maximum number of rounds should be set based on the number of players to ensure there are enough cards.
- **Dealer hits on 'soft' 17**: The dealer should now hit on a total of 17 if one of their cards is an Ace (soft 17).
- **Blackjack auto-win**: If a player gets a Blackjack (an Ace and a face card, but not a 10), they should automatically win—unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case it results in a push.
- **Support betting**: Each player starts with £100. At the beginning of each round, players can place a bet (any whole number up to their current balance). If they win against the dealer, they receive double their bet. If they lose or go bust, they forfeit the bet.
- **Advanced betting**: Blackjack now pays out at 3:2. Players have the option to 'double' their original bet but can only take one more card.
- **Split betting**: If a player is dealt a pair, they can choose to 'split' their hand and play two separate hands.
- **Card Counting Assistant**: Display a simplified count for the player (e.g., Hi-Lo system) and notify them when the deck is favorable.
- **AI Opponents**: Introduce computer-controlled players with different playstyles. At the start of the game, allow players to add AI opponents (with a total limit of 5 players). Support at least two distinct AI playstyles.


# Card Deck Simulator

## Overview

This is a simple Node.js-based HTTP server that simulates a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The server provides two endpoints:

/get-card: Draws the next card from the deck.

/shuffle: Shuffles and resets the deck.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Installing Node.js

If Node.js is not already installed, follow these steps:

**Download Node.js**: Visit the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/)

**Install Node.js**: Choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

node -v

If installed correctly, this will display the Node.js version.

## Installation

Clone the repository or copy the source code to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the following command to start the server:

node DeckOfCards.js

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the endpoints:

Draw a Card

To get the next card in the deck, make a GET request to:

curl http://localhost:9090/get-card

Example Response:

{
"card": "7H"
}

If the deck is empty, it returns:

{
"card": null
}

Shuffle the Deck

To shuffle and reset the deck, make a GET request to:

curl http://localhost:9090/shuffle

Example Response:

{
"message": "Deck shuffled!"
}

## Notes

The deck is automatically shuffled when the server starts.

Once all cards are drawn, /get-card will return null until the deck is shuffled again.
